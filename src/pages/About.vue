              I learned at the early age of nine years that I could spell better than many of my classmates, acing all of my vocabulary tests. Then, by 19, in my first round of undergrad, my fellow students brought their papers to me for revisions. All that being said, I didn't believe that I was any better at writing or editing than others. My literature and writing career up to that point had been primarily reading SparkNotes and skipping class on the days we were to submit our written assignments; I had not even started mine.

              The only thing I had written, with any personally perceived success, was when I was 15; it was a "lengthy" 6-page paper in response to the vague prompt, "what led me to this [outlaw life]?" That assigned essay, which I titled "Soul Friend," was submitted to Colorado's 2nd District Juvenile Court and published in my now-expunged underage record. Maybe in some circles that counts as being a published author? Probably not.

                I no longer claim to be the teenage rebel without a cause, who suffered not only a home grounding, but a court date to which my fuming parents dragged me in my Sunday best in the middle of the work week. Rather, now, I am a nurse. I am also a writer. I am a traveler, a total foodie, a rock climber, and a professional dog park frequenter with my merry band of misfits. And the days of my juvenile delinquency are now the fuel for my mother's favorite stories to recount at social gatherings.

                As an adult, writing started as an outlet to navigate my personal demons of anxiety, depression, and PTSD related to being a nurse during the pandemic. However, these days, it has become an essential skill and pastime. Just as I would like to think that I have mastered the APA v.7 Style Guide (thank you, Purdue Owl) during my prolific professional and academic writing career in nursing, the rules change. Even when I believe I have nailed down the perfect sentence, the rules change.
              </p>
              
              <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                While I further my study of writing by taking courses on sentence structure, reading a memoir on the craft, or committing to memory Strunk & White's elements, the rules may be different, and the advice changes (except for the elimination of useless words and the blasphemous adverb). Through those, I have changed. I have evolved from a novice nurse to an educator and from a scribbler to a writer.

                I teach my new nurses that there are many means to the same end. I believe writing is also a means to an end of expression and connection. As I embark upon this new writing journey, I hope to connect with other writers and my readers. As a nurse, my audience is my patients and students, but here I hope that my audience will be you. I aim to grow as a professional writer and build a community with adventurous, creative, and pet-loving literaries. To quote my favorite author and adventurer, Jon Krakauer, "I now walk into the wild."
